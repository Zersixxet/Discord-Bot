One of the most prominent features provided by Discord is the official support for bot accounts. In a matter of 20 seconds, anyone can receive an official bot account in order to enhance the experience for members of their chat server. However, up until this point, manipulating a bot would require significant amounts of programming experience. It's time for that to change.

Discord Bot Maker is powerful, yet flexible, tool that allows both experienced programmers and bot newcomers to construct outstandingly effective bots in a matter of seconds. By piecing together actions that may occur through commands or events, one may create the bot of their dreams!
Features

Discord Bot Maker uses a system based on "commands" and "events". Commands are manually called functions that invoke specific actions. These are done by sending specific words or phrases into the chat. The other half of the system involves "events". These will invoke functions based on certain conditions, such as members leaving/joining the server, the creation of channels, the banning of members, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏èBoth commands and events call upon "actions" that the developer selects. Here's a sample of some of the supported actions:

* Sending Messages
* Generating Embedded Messages
* Creating Roles and Channels
* Sending Local Files
* Dynamically Editing Images
* Manipulating Emojis
* Storing and Controlling Data
* Applying Logic Sequencing
* Banning or Kicking Members
* Being Awesome
* And much more!
